              I am currently in the Tulsa, Oklahoma area. Before I was able to
              code up a website, I was working at Walgreens as a shift lead.
              After time, I believed I could be doing more with my time and I
              could be getting paid more for my work. On my freetime, I was
              learning how to code the basics in Python. Coding was amazing! As
              a user, I would type in words and special functions and magic
              would appear on the screen all due to the code typed in. After
              some time I stumbled upon a bootcamp, Lambda School, from which I
              have been taught most my coding skills. When I have had some time
              to myself, I have decided to look into some extra coding skills
              that were not requested by the curriculum. Just a couple extra
              bits that I kept hearing would be a good litle bit of coding
              knowledge to have. Through Lambda learned how to write the basic
              website languages of the internet, HTML and CSS. After that was
              nice and grasped, I was able to pickup JavaScript and then move up
              to React.js and Node.js with Express. Lambda even went through
              Computer Science fundemantals while teaching Python through their
              curriculum.
