## Portfolio Page

April 2020 -- This is the portfolio page for Michael Perez. Worked on this in the beginning of April 2020. Mainly HTML and CSS on a project I had attempted to do a while back. It uses a couple of skews that threw me off the first time.
August 2020 -- I learned quite a bit of react. This page is going to be remade and improved.
