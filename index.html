                            This project was done over the course of a week. As
                            of April 2020, it is only a demonstration of front
                            end coding. Main languages are HTML and CSS, with
                            LESS as a pre-processor. Med Cabinet is an app to
                            assist new cannabis users, as well as experienced
                            users, in helps of keeping people off of
                            pharmaceuticals, plus find their right ailment.

                            I am currently in the Tulsa, Oklahoma area. Before I
                            was able to code up a website, I was working at
                            walgreens. I was a shift leader there. After some
                            time I wanted to reach out and get a better paying
                            job. On my freetime, I was learning how to code in
                            Python. After some time with coding, my brain was
                            filing with amazing feeling endorphins. After some
                            time I stumbled upon a bootcamp, Lambda School, from
                            which I have been gathering most my coding skills.
                            When I have had some time to myself, I have decided
                            to look into some extra coding skills that were not
                            requested by the curriculum. Just a couple extra
                            bits that I kept hearing would be a good litle bit
                            of coding knowledge to have. I have learned how to
                            write the basic website languages of the internet,
                            HTML and CSS. After that was nice and grasped, I was
                            able to pickup JavaScript. We are going thru React
                            and at some point I will continue on the path of
                            Python.
